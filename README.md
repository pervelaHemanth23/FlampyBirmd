# FLAMPY BIRMD

This game is a Parody of the smash hit iPhone game Flappy Bird.

### Features of this game:-

* The game has a simple yet fully functional User Interface(UI) with a main menu, options screen, quit button etc.
* Simple controls ;P. Press space to make your bird flap.
* Main Objective is to get make the bird fly without getting hit by the pipes
* A Score system keeps track of every pipe you successfully go through without colliding and a HighScore system keeps track of the highest score you got to in the previous sessions.
* The main menu also displays the High Score and you have an option to reset it.
* The options menu has an option to turn the in game volume UP and DOWN

### What i learnt from this project:-

* How to get going with UNITY.
* How to create gameObjects and give them the required properties like sprite renderers, box colliders, physics etc.
* Working with invisible triggers and prefabs.
* Spawning objects and timing them properly.
* Referencing objects in script DURING runtime.
* Working with User interface (UI) and scoring systems.
* Managing scenes in UNITY.
* Making Main Menu screens and options screens using both Legacy and Text Mesh Pro.
* Working with particle systems.
* Using PlayerPrefs to store high scores in Hard disk
* Working with sliders in unity.
* Plagarism is the best way to learn game development because we, as novice game developers, needn't care about design, art style, mechanics etc cause they are already given to us. We can focus on building the most important aspect, i.e. the code.

# Flampy Birmd 2.0

Now this is something original!

I added an extra mechanic to my Flampy Birmd game to make it more interesting and challenging

Now you will have a target that will spawn before the pipe does
You will have to hit the **RIGHT ARROW KEY** to eject an arrow from the bird
If the arrow HITS the target, the pipe will spawn and you can go through it to keep the score ticking

I have uploaded both the versions in GitHub

**The 2.0 Version is still a work in progress.** Things i will have to fix include but are not limited to:

* Make the arrow fall down after it hits the target
* If the arrow doesn't hit the target, the bird will fly indefinitely. I would want to kill the bird if the arrow misses the target.


*Download and extract the Flampy Birmd 2.0 .zip file to access the game.*
*Open the FlampyBirmd.exe to run the game*

I have started working on another UNITY 2D project. This time i am attempting to recreate a platformer inspired by Mario forever with the knowledge i have gained from this project.

***A TINY ACHIEVEMENT***

I submitted my project idea and a prototype of Flampy Birmd 2.0 for a game design competition conducted by my university. I was awarded the 1st prize and a cash reward of 1500-/ ;)
